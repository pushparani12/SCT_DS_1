This repository demonstrates my projects undertaken during my Data Science internship at SkillCraft. It emphasizes the practical implementations of data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in solving real-world issues. Throughout my internship, I acquired practical experience with various techniques in data handling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and statistical methodologies. The projects are intended to address business problems and derive meaningful insights from large datasets, aiming to enhance decision-making and optimize performance.
